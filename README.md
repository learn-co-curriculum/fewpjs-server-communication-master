# You're a Server Communication Master

## Reflect

Let's touch base with the reference example we started out with, our "Simple
Liker" app. Through it, we can interact with all three of our pillars of front-
end web programming:

- ☑ Manipulating the DOM
- ☑ Recognizing JavaScript events
- ☑ Communicating with the server

You've just finished learning about pillar three, communicating with the server.
You figured out asynchrony, practiced requesting and sending data and became an
expert using `fetch()`. Now when you click on an empty heart to favorite a post,
you can trace each step of the process—from finding the relevant part of the DOM
to responding to an event to sending new information to the server to updating
the DOM—that results in that happy little full red heart.

## Next Step

There's only one more step to take from here: pulling it all together. Next
we'll take everything we've learned so far and use it to make our own web
application.
